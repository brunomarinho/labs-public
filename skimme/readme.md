# Skimme

Skimme is a MacOS system tray app that simplifies your journey to mastering songs with Apple Music. By using your keyboard arrows, you can effortlessly rewind or advance the playhead during song playback.

## Why Skimme?

Keyboard shortcuts provide the necessary precision and agility, allowing your attention to stay tuned to the music, rather than the computer interface. Unfortunately, this is not a behavior that Apple Music natively supports.
